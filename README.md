# README

This project is inspired by [Splitwise](splitwise.com) and is an opportunity for me to practice back-end development in Ruby on Rails as well as HTML and CSS. divyUp allows users to create groups for things like trips or shared apartment expenses, upload receipts, and calculate the dollar amount that each group member owes (or is owed) based on the amount they contributed to the group.  

## Features
In addition to the core feature of tracking group expenses and calculating the shared cost, divyUp supports these features:
- Friending
- Secure login
- Ability to calculate an uneven split based on percentages that the user inputs

Additional features that I plan to implement in the future include:
- Email notifications for friend requests/group invitations
- An option to allow a group to "settle up"
- Option to upload a photo of a receipt

## Built With
-Ruby on Rails
-PostgreSQL
