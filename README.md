# README

This project is inspired by [Splitwise](http://splitwise.com) and is an opportunity for me to practice back-end development in Ruby on Rails, as well as HTML and CSS. divyUp allows users to create a group for things like trips or shared apartment expenses, upload receipts for that group, and calculate the dollar amount that each group member owes (or is owed) based on the amount they have contributed to the group.  

## Features
In addition to the core feature of tracking group expenses and calculating shared costs, divyUp supports these features:
- Friending
- Ability to calculate an uneven split based on percentages that the user inputs
- Secure login

Additional features that I plan to implement in the future include:
- Email notifications for friend requests/group invitations
- An option to allow a group to "settle up"
- Option to upload a photo of a receipt

## Built With
- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- HTML
- CSS
